# Gravito Framework 🌌

Gravito is a modular, high-performance TypeScript framework built for the modern web. It leverages the **Galaxy Architecture**—a unique approach inspired by celestial mechanics to manage lifecycle, extensions (Orbits), and domain-specific plugins (Satellites).

> **Version 1.0 is here!** Build complex e-commerce systems by simply composing modules.

## 🌟 The Galaxy Architecture

Gravito is built on the principle of **"Rigorous Core, Flexible Perimeter."** It strictly enforces **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** and **Clean Architecture** internally while providing a minimalist experience for developers.

- **Micro-Kernel (PlanetCore)**: A self-developed, ultra-lightweight engine that manages hooks and lifecycle events.
- **Orbits (Infrastructure)**: Strategic extensions (Database, Auth, Messaging) that "orbit" the core, providing essential resources.
- **Satellites (Domain Plugins)**: Self-contained business units (Catalog, Cart, Payment) that implement specific domains using Clean Architecture.

## 🚀 E-Commerce 1.0: Manifest-Driven Assembly

The 1.0 release introduces **"MDD" (Manifest-Driven Development)**. You can now assemble a full-featured e-commerce site by simply declaring what you need.

### The "Three-File" Rule
1. **`package.json`**: Add your satellites.
2. **`gravito.config.ts`**: Declare your features.
3. **`entry-server.ts`**: One line to ignite the entire ecosystem.

### Example Configuration
```typescript
// gravito.config.ts
export default {
  name: 'Flagship Store',
  modules: [
    'catalog',    // Products & Variants
    'membership', // Auth & User Profiles
    'analytics',  // Data & Charts
    'support',    // Real-time Chat
    'cms'         // News & Announcements
  ]
};
```
